<h3 style="text-align: center;">EVE-PRO re-hosting or reinstallation.</h3>

<p>If you decide to re-install EVE-PRO or move it to another host, please follow the steps below:</p>

<h4>Pre-requisites:</h4>

<ul>
    <li>EVE must have internet access!</li>
    <li>Only ONE EVE host must be turned ON and connected to the internet, do NOT have more than one EVE with the same license turned on at the same time!</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1. Make sure that you have only ONE EVE-PRO instance with this license running.</p>

<p>Step 2. Make sure you have unrestricted Internet access with a properly configured DNS server from your EVE machine or configure the firewall rule for EVE Licensing server access and license validation: Bidirectional (in/out)&nbsp; allowed access to: https://www-eve-ng.net</p>

<p>Step 3. Load your purchased license onto EVE server you want to rehost to.</p>

<p>Step 4. Reboot your new EVE</p>

<p>Step 5. Wait approximately 15 mins for the licence validation process to finish on the host.</p>

<p><span style="color:#e74c3c;">NOTE: The re-hosted EVE server must have internet access to periodically validate the license.</span> EVE receives a token with a licence validity time of 24 hours. During those 24 hours, the re-hosted EVE can be used offline. After 24 hours the token time expires and you have to get EVE online again (for approximately 30minutes) to receive a new token.</p>
